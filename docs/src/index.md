# TikhonovFenichelReductions.jl

A Julia package for computing Tikhonov-Fenichel Parameter Values (TFPVs) for
polynomial ODE systems and their corresponding reductions as described in
[goeke2013a,goeke2014,goeke2015](@cite).

## Overview
The general framework for this package is singular perturbation theory.
More precisely, we consider a system of ODEs in the form 
```math
\begin{split}
\dot{x} = f(x,\pi, \varepsilon) = f^{(0)}(x,\pi) + \varepsilon f^{(1)}(x,\pi), 
\\
x(0)=x_0, x \in U\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n, \pi \in \Pi \subseteq \mathbb{R}^m,
\end{split}
```
where ``f \in \mathbb{R}[x,\pi]`` is polynomial and ``\varepsilon \geq 0`` is a
small parameter. 
The results from [goeke2013a,goeke2014,goeke2015](@cite) allow us to compute a
reduced system for ``\varepsilon \to 0`` in the sense of Tikhonov
[tikhonov1952](@cite) and Fenichel [fenichel1979](@cite) using methods from
commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. 

`TikhonovFenichelReductions.jl` provides procedures for finding all possible
TFPV candidates that yield a reduction in the sense of Tikhonov's theorem (see
[verhulst2007](@cite)) and functions to simplify the computation of the
corresponding reduced systems.
Note that this approach yields all possible timescale separations of _rates_ and
not just _components_ as in the classical approach.

## Finding TFPV candidates
To find TFPV candidates admitting a reduced system of dimension ``s`` with
`TikhonovFenichelReductions.jl`, one needs to create an instance of type
`ReductionProblem` holding all relevant information. 
Then, there are two different approaches briefly introduced as follows (see
[Getting Started](@ref) for a practical discussion).

#### Slow-Fast Separations
We call a parameter vector, in which some components are set to zero (i.e. the
small parameters), a slow-fast separation of rates. 
Most TFPVs we are interested in are slow-fast separations, because they directly
relate to a slow-fast separation of processes, but there might exist TFPVs that
are characterized by rational expressions in the original parameters being
small. 
The approach for finding all slow-fast separations of rates is implemented in
the function `tfpv_candidates`.
Roughly speaking, this checks algorithmically for all possible slow-fast
separations of rates if there exists an irreducible component of dimension
``s``, since these correspond to the potential slow manifolds on which a
reduction is defined.
Additionally, we use a condition on the Jacobian of ``f`` with respect to ``x``
to filter out potential candidates. 
Afterwards, it only remains to check whether the slow manifold can be given in
closed form (explicitly) as a subset of ``\mathbb{R}^n``. 
With this, one can then compute the reduced system.


#### All TFPVs
To get *all* possible TFPVs, we can consider necessary conditions concerning
``D_1 f``, i.e. the Jacobian of ``f`` w.r.t. the components of the system.
For this, we can compute a Gröbner basis `G` of an ideal in ``\mathbb{R}[\pi]``
(the elimination ideal of the ideal generated by ``f`` and all determinants of
``k\times k`` minors of ``D_1f`` for ``k>s``). 
Then, every TFPV must result in the vanishing of `G`.
Thus, we may also obtain more complicated expressions in the parameters that
are considered small.
The Gröbner basis `G` can be computed by calling `tfpv_groebner_basis`. 
Given a TFPV defined by rational expressions, one can rewrite the original
system with a new parameter equal to this expression, which makes it a slow-fast
separation of rates. 
Then, the approach discussed above becomes applicable allowing us to compute the
reduced system.
