This returns a vector of boolean indices for each TFPV candidate, where 0 corresponds to a small parameters, i.e. those multiplied by varepsilon, and 1 corresponds to a parameter in mathcalO(1). In addition, we obtain the generators of the irreducible components of the affine variety \n\nmathcalV_mathbbC(f(cdotpi^star)) = xinmathbbC^n mid f(xpi^star)=0\n\nand their dimension, where pi^star is defined by the corresponding slow-fast separation in tfpvs.  This information is stored using the type Variety. Note that we later have to check manually whether the variety taken in mathbbR^n has the same dimension (i.e. if there exists a real non-singular point), which then at least locally renders this variety a manifold.\n\ntfpvs, varieties = tfpvs_and_varieties(problem);\n\nShow the results: All possible slow-fast separation of rates \n\nprint_tfpvs(problem, tfpvs)\n\nand the corresponding irreducible components containing the slow manifold and their Krull dimension\n\nprint_varieties(varieties)\n\nFor further use, we need to make the variables (the system components and parameters) available in the Main namespace.

We can see that there is only one irreducible component, so the slow manifold is  mathcalV_mathbbR(H) = (BS0) mid BS in mathbbR with (real) dimension s=2 as desired.\n\nWe need to define the slow manifold explicitly in order to check whether the reduction exists.  This also allows to substitute the variables that got reduced according to the slow manifold in the reduced system.\n\nset_manifold!(reduction, [B, S, 0])\n\nNote that in this case any generic point on the affine variety is non-singular and can be chosen as x_0.   Thus, we don't have to call set_point! to set a non-singular point explicitly on whose neighbourhood the reduction exists.  This also means dim mathcalV_mathbbC(f(cdotpi^star)) = dim mathcalV_mathbbR(f(cdotpi^star)) locally for the irreducible component containing the non-singular point.\n\nLastly, we define a product decomposition f(cdotpi^star) = P cdot psi with mathcalV(psi) = mathcalV(f(cdotpi^star)). In most cases this can be done by specifying only psi using the generators of the irreducible component of mathcalV(f^(0)) that corresponds to the slow manifold. Here, P can be computed automatically, which relies on having exactly r generators of the variety corresponding to the slow manifold.\n\nset_decomposition!(reduction, varieties[15][1])\n\nIf this method fails, you can manually set P and Psi.\n\nNow we can compute and show the reduced system.\n\ncompute_reduction!(reduction);\n\nThis updates the reduction object, which now contains the reduced system before and after variables are substituted as defined by the slow manifold.

Due to [1–3] we can compute the reduction for this system, i.e. its limit for varepsilon to 0, in the sense of Tikhonov [5] and Fenichel [6] using methods from commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.  Note that this yields all possible timescale separations of rates and not just components as in the classical approach. Thus, this is a coordinate-independent approach to geometric singular perturbation theory.\n\nTikhonovFenichelReductions.jl provides procedures for finding all possible TFPV candidates that yield a reduction in the sense of Tikhonov's theorem (see [7]) and functions to simplify the computation of the corresponding reduced systems.","category":"section"},{"location":"#Finding-TFPV-Candidates","page":"TikhonovFenichelReductions.jl","title":"Finding TFPV Candidates","text":"To find TFPV candidates admitting a reduced system of dimension s, one needs to create an instance of type ReductionProblem holding all relevant information.

Thus, we have f^(0)=f(cdotpi^star).\n\nMost TFPVs we are interested in are of this type, because they directly relate to a slow-fast separation of processes. However, there might exist TFPVs that are characterized by more complicated expressions in the original parameters being small (see the next section). \n\nThe function tfpvs_and_varieties yields all slow-fast separations of rates that are TFPVs and the corresponding varieties mathcalV(f^(0)). Roughly speaking, this method checks for all possible slow-fast separations of rates pi^star whether there exists an irreducible component of mathcalV(f^(0)) with the desired dimension s, since these correspond to the potential slow manifolds on which a reduction is defined. Additionally, we use a condition on the Jacobian D_1f^(0) to filter out potential candidates.  Afterwards, it only remains to check whether the slow manifold can be given in parameterized form as a subset of mathbbR^n.  With this, one can then compute the reduced system.","category":"section"},{"location":"#All-TFPVs","page":"TikhonovFenichelReductions.jl","title":"All TFPVs","text":"To get all possible TFPVs pi, we consider necessary conditions concerning D_1 f and f – namely the existence of a point x_0inmathbbR^n for which f(x_0pi) and the determinants of each ktimes k minor of D_1 f(x_0pi) vanish for kn-s. Let I be the ideal generated by these polynomial expressions. Then, all TFPVs are contained in mathcalV(I) taken in mathbbR^m.\n\nThere might be several slow manifolds for each pi, wherefore we only  consider conditions for the parameters and not the state variables x.  For this, we compute the elimination ideal I_pi=IcapmathbbRpi.  Given a Gröbner basis G of I w.r.t. an elimination ordering for x, I_pi is generated by GcapmathbbRpi, i.e. all polynomials in G not containing the state variables x. Then, every TFPV must result in the vanishing of each polynomial in GcapmathbbRpi, because one always has mathcalV(I) subseteq mathcalV(I_pi). Thus, we may obtain more complicated expressions in the original parameters that can be considered small (instead of just slow-fast separations of rates).\n\nGcapmathbbRpi can be computed by calling tfpvs_groebner.  Given a TFPV defined by some expressions, one can rewrite the original system with a new parameter equal to this expression, which makes it a slow-fast separation of rates.
