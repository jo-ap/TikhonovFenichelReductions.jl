Most TFPVs we are interested in are of this type, because they directly relate to a slow-fast separation of processes. However, there might exist TFPVs that are characterized by rational expressions in the original parameters being small.  The approach for finding all slow-fast separations of rates is implemented in the function tfpv_candidates. Roughly speaking, this checks for all possible slow-fast separations of rates whether there exists an irreducible component of dimension s, since the latter correspond to the potential slow manifolds on which a reduction is defined. Additionally, we use a condition on the Jacobian D_1f to filter out potential candidates.  Afterwards, it only remains to check whether the slow manifold can be given in parameterized form as a subset of mathbbR^n.  With this, one can then compute the reduced system.","category":"page"},{"location":"#All-TFPVs","page":"TikhonovFenichelReductions.jl","title":"All TFPVs","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"TikhonovFenichelReductions.jl","title":"TikhonovFenichelReductions.jl","text":"To get all possible TFPVs, we consider necessary conditions concerning D_1 f and f – namely the existence of a point x_0inmathbbR^n for which f(x_0pi^star) and the determinant of each ktimes k minor of D_1 f(x_0pi^star) for kn-s vanish. These will be polynomial expressions that form an ideal I and if the original polynomials vanish, so does every polynomial in I. There might be several slow manifolds for each pi^star, wherefore we consider conditions only on the parameters.  For this we can compute the elimination ideal IcapmathbbRpi. In practice, the elimination ideal can be computed as GcapmathbbRpi, where G is a Gröbner basis of I with an elimination ordering for x. Then, every TFPV must result in the vanishing of each polynomial in the set G. Thus, we may obtain more complicated expressions in the parameters that are considered small parameters (instead of just slow-fast separations of rates). GcapmathbbRpi can be computed by calling tfpv_groebner_basis.  Given a TFPV defined by rational expressions, one can rewrite the original system with a new parameter equal to this expression, which makes it a slow-fast separation of rates.  Then, the approach discussed above becomes applicable allowing us to compute the reduced system.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Dependencies","page":"TikhonovFenichelReductions.jl","title":"Dependencies","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"TikhonovFenichelReductions.jl","title":"TikhonovFenichelReductions.jl","text":"This packages only works due to the great Oscar.jl project.","category":"page"},{"location":"#License","page":"TikhonovFenichelReductions.jl","title":"License","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"TikhonovFenichelReductions.jl","title":"TikhonovFenichelReductions.jl","text":"GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, Version 3 or later (see LICENSE)","category":"page"}]
